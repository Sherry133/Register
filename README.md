## School Savings Registration Banner

This banner is an Html5 banner school webmasters can insert in their school's website or online newsletter. The purpose of the banner is to enable parents to register their children to save a school through School Savings in cooperation with a local financial institution.

## Documentation

The Html5 banner consists of the following items within a DIST folder:
1. <index.html>
2. <css/style.css>
3. <js/script.js>
4. '<img'>folder with three files, one of which is a video.


Below is a link to see it running on github. Note the ad may have a different video or slightly revised text than the one enclosed in this deployment of the banner.

The size of the banner is 350 X 600 pixels and it is responsive. The size of the banner can be easily modified by changing the width and height in the 'showcase' css in <style.css>. Larger size changes may require some text size modifications.

## Installation

Copy the code you need from the index.html file into YOUR editor's index.html FILE being careful not to duplicate existing code. Be sure to rename the css link and javascript <scr >files (style.css and script.js) to meet your needs, if necessary.

Copy the <img >folder into your banner system (if one exists) and rename the folder and file names, if necessary. SUBSTITUTE YOUR BANK PARTNER'S LOGO FOR THE FIB ONE. Ask the person who sent you this information for for logo the bank uses.

Copy the <script.js >file into your javascript folder and rename the file if you already have a script.js file. Add the reference link in the index.html file to the script.js file.

Copy the style.css file into your 'css' folder and rename the file if you already have style.css file. Change the reference link from the index.html file to the style.css file unless you are just adding the code to an existing css file.
